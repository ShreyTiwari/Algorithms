# Algorithms

This repository contains implementation codes of most of the algorithms basic to any programmer. 
Each of the programs is split into primarily three files:-
-Header
-Implementation
-Client

The make file in each of the files compile's the three file's and produces a executable file named 'a.out'
There are a number of input files that the program is tested against and the expected output is also present
in the individual folders.
